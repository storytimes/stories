Die Hard (1988)
===============

1. We fade in on John McClaine, a hardboiled NYC cop on an airplane
   who doesn't like to fly. 

2. We realize now that John's marriage is rocky. His wife got a nice
   job in L.A. and he refused to come here with her. Now he's visiting
   for Christmas. She's using her maiden name in the corporate
   directory. They're bickering. Things are not right, and if you
   could read the protagonist's mind, you might find him wishing there
   was something he could do to save his marriage.

3. Terrorists attack the Christmas party, and now John McClaine has
   his chance to literally save his rocky marriage. Trouble is, John's
   held back by his old way of thinking. He's a cop with a code of
   honor, but the terrorists fight dirty.

4. John McClaine is advised by a terrorist to whom he earlier showed
   mercy: "The next time you have a chance to kill someone, don't
   hesitate." John shoots him several times and thanks his corpse for
   the advice. The cop has begun to fall away, piece by piece,
   revealing his inner cowboy.

5. John McClaine, having run over broken glass, is sitting in a
   bathroom, soaking his bloody feet in the sink. It is at this moment
   that he finally realizes the true extent of his love for his wife,
   and what he's been doing wrong in their marriage. He (1) has been
   too stubborn (2). He uses his walkie talkie, acquired in step (4),
   to give a message to his wife through his benevolent, happily
   married, gun-shy counterpart: "She's heard me say 'I love you' a
   thousand times...but she's never heard me say I'm sorry."

6. Having made his peace (5) regarding his marriage, John McClaine now
   wonders why Hans Gruber, head terrorist, was so desperate for those
   detonators. He goes back to the roof and discovers that the entire
   upper portion of the skyscraper is wired to blow. With this
   realization comes the consequence (6): The giant blonde terrorist
   descends on him and the two will now battle to the
   death. Dispatching Blondie is only the first step. The trials on
   this road come fast and furious. By the time the protagonist gets
   to (7), the last remaining shreds of his ego will have disappeared
   and he will have accomplished what Campbell calls the "Atonement
   with the Father-" The father being this completely non-personal,
   no-bullshit universe, usually embodied, in action films, by the bad
   guy (who is often heard to say, in these more arch films, "Nothing
   personal. Just business."). He is now a god who can appear on the
   roof, dispatch terrorists with ease and herd 50 hostages to safety
   while dodging gunfire from an FBI helicopter

7. John McClaine, who at step (1) was afraid of flying, now wraps a
   fire hose around his waist and leaps off an exploding building,
   then shoots a giant window so he can kick through it with his
   bloody feet. Strangely enough, he will soon find himself back in
   the same room where the Christmas party was being held.

8. Having killed every terrorist - each time dropping more and more
   neurotic luggage, McClaine now stands, unarmed, nearly naked,
   before his wife. There's only one problem. Hans Gruber, the
   unconscious shadow version of John (is "Hans" German for "John?"),
   is also here, having "followed" him up to the ordinary world, as
   shadows are prone to do. He's got a gun to her head. And, he's got
   one more goon - you know, the guy that played "Nick the Dick" in
   Bachelor Party (who would've thought he'd last the longest?)

   Fortunately, the real John has spent his storytime learning new
   behaviors, while Shadow John has spent his storytime attempting to
   cling to his crumbling ego. Real John has learned, in particular,
   that sometimes your best offense is surrender. He came around the
   corner with his otherworldly submachine gun, and was ordered to
   drop it. Now Shadow John, at (8) thinks he has what was so
   desperately necessary to Real John at (1): Control. He has John's
   wife as an unwilling hostage. And, of course, like a good villain,
   Hans would never dream of throwing away the opportunity to gloat as
   he levels his gun on John.

   But John's SMG was empty. He had placed his last two bullets from
   the unconscious world back into his old, conscious, New York penis
   pistol, the one he had on the plane, the one that is now taped to
   his back with ..(blush) Christmas tape. Okay, look, it's a pretty
   good script up until that point. Anyways, John pulls the concealed
   gun, shoots Shadow John through his black, uncompromising, German
   heart, shoots Nick the Dick in the forehead, and, as his wife and
   Hans nearly both tumble through the broken window, John is able to
   release his love once and for all by releasing the clasp on the
   Rolex given to her by an L.A. cokehead yuppy. The watch, and Hans,
   tumble through the air, the principal from Breakfast Club says "I
   hope that's not a hostage," and so concludes the 20th century's
   greatest action film.

   Well, not quite. The proper, jive talking, submissive, comic relief
   black chaueffer has to punch out the improper, hyperintelligent,
   uppity black computer hacker, thereby making slavery more heroic
   than terrorism and restoring security to caucasian society. Also,
   the child-murdering, gun-shy L.A. cop has to blow away the freshly
   resurrected Blonde terrorist, reacquainting himself with the fact
   that sometimes, killing the right type of person can be a life
   affirming act.
